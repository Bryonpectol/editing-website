          I am a student at Utah Valley University,
          studying Web Development and programming. I am currently a part time
          worker at the University Mall in Orem as a sales associate at Tie One
          On. I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
          Saints in Guayaquil, Ecuador. I know how to speak Spanish as a second
          language. I am working on getting my undergraduate in Web Development
          and after that, I plan to use my Bachelor's Degree to start my own
          online retail company with my brother, Bryce Pectol . I will then
          further my education in the future when my business has become stable
          and I will work on getting my minor in Business Management.
